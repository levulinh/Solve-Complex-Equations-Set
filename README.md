How to input the coefficients?

For normal form:
a+bi, a+bj, a, bi, bj, a+j
with a, b are in double, 'i' or 'j' are the letter to define the complex number
Example:
3+2i, 3-5.3j, 3i

For Euler form:
r a phi
with r is the magnitude and phi is the argument of the complex number
phi in degree.
'a' or 'A' is the letter that separates r and phi
Example:
3a30, -2a45

You can input both form of complex numbers in the same equations set. Result returned in normal complex number form.
